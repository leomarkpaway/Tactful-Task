**Tactful Task** started as a simple to-do app, designed to help users manage everyday tasks. As I continue development, I am currently adding new features and enhancing the UI using the latest technologies, including Jetpack Compose. The app already offers essential functionality such as task scheduling, notification reminders, and task pinning, and it is evolving into a more versatile and feature-rich productivity tool.

With these enhancements, the app gained its own identity, and I decided to name it **Tactful Task**—a smart task manager that goes beyond the basics. In addition to adding new features, I am migrating the app’s architecture from MVVM to MVI, which is better suited for Jetpack Compose's reactive UI model. This transition will help improve state management and make the app more scalable and maintainable.

## 🎯 **Features**

- 📅 Schedule Tasks: Plan your tasks ahead of time, set deadlines, and stay on top of your to-do list.
- 🔔 Notification Reminder: Get timely reminders for your scheduled tasks to ensure nothing slips through the cracks.
- 📌 Pin Tasks: Pin important tasks to the top of your list so you can focus on what matters most.

## 🚀 **Future Features**
Continually working to make Tactful Task even better. Here are some exciting features planned for future updates:

- 📅 Calendar View: Visualize all your tasks on a calendar, making it easier to manage deadlines and get a full view of your schedule.
- ⏳ Pomodoro Timer: Improve productivity with a built-in Pomodoro timer to help you focus on tasks in short, efficient intervals.
- 🧠 Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, a smart decision-making framework to help you focus on what's urgent and important.
